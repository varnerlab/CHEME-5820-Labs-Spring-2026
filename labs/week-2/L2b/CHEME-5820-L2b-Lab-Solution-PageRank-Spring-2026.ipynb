    "In this lab, we'll explore PageRank, an algorithm that ranks web pages by importance. While a naive approach might simply count incoming links, we'll discover why this fails and how PageRank uses Markov chains and eigenvector computation to address these limitations.\n",

    "> __What is PageRank?__\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The [PageRank algorithm, developed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin](http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/422/), is used by Google Search to rank web pages in their search engine results. It infers importance purely from link structure: incoming links are votes weighted by the importance of the linking page and diluted by its number of outgoing links. At its core, PageRank models web browsing as a Markov chain, where each webpage represents a state and hyperlinks define transition probabilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll represent a small network of webpages as a directed graph, examine why naive in-degree counting is insufficient, construct the corresponding transition matrix (a stochastic matrix), and use the power iteration method to compute the stationary distribution (scaled dominant eigenvector) of this Markov chain, which we call PageRank scores.\n",

    "> * __Understand why naive ranking fails:__ Recognize the limitations of in-degree counting and why source quality and link distribution matter.\n",
    "> * __Build and interpret transition matrices:__ Construct normalized stochastic matrices from adjacency matrices that properly encode importance transfer weighted by source authority.\n",
    "> * __Apply power iteration to find PageRank:__ Compute the stationary distribution of a Markov chain using power iteration and contrast it with naive in-degree ranking to understand how iterative refinement captures network-based importance.\n",

    "#### Interpreting the comparison\n",
    "Look at the comparison table to understand how PageRank differs from naive in-degree ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __What should we look for?__\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The table reveals three patterns that explain why PageRank captures network importance better than simple link counting:\n",
    "> * __Consensus rankings:__ Pages appearing in both top-10 lists have earned high rankings through both metrics. They're linked to frequently AND by important sources, representing genuine importance.\n",
    "> * __Popularity vs. authority:__ Pages high in in-degree but lower in PageRank attract many links from low-authority pages. The votes are numerous but from weak sources. Conversely, pages low in in-degree but high in PageRank receive few links from highly authoritative sources. A single link from an authority confers significant PageRank, revealing how importance transfers through the network.\n",
    "> * __Source quality and dilution:__ PageRank accounts for two critical factors that in-degree ignores. First, links from important pages carry more weight than links from obscure pages. Second, a page linking to 1000 sites distributes its importance across all of them, while a page linking to only 5 sites concentrates its importance on those 5. This prevents manipulation by pages that indiscriminately link to everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "This comparison illustrates why PageRank became important to search engines: it's robust against gaming and reflects a deeper notion of network importance than simple link counting."

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab shows why naive link counting is insufficient for ranking importance in networks, and how PageRank uses iteration and weighted links based on Markov chain theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Key Takeaways:__\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * **Naive in-degree ranking fails because it treats all votes equally:** Link counting ignores source quality and is vulnerable to manipulation. PageRank's weighted approach addresses this by making importance depend on the authority of your linkers, not just link quantity.\n",
    "> * **Transition matrices and stationary distributions encode network importance:** Normalizing adjacency matrices by out-degree creates a stochastic matrix whose stationary distribution (eigenvalue $\\lambda = 1$) represents the long-run visiting probability in a random walk, which is what PageRank computes.\n",
    "> * **Power iteration makes PageRank computable at scale:** Rather than expensive eigendecomposition, power iteration converges rapidly to the dominant eigenvector through simple matrix multiplications, making PageRank feasible for billions of pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "PageRank recognizes that importance in networks is both local, incoming links, and global, the quality of linkers, which is why it remains useful in modern ranking algorithms."
